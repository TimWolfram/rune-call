            Tjall is a trick-taking game similar to <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hearts_(card_game)">Hearts</a>. It is played with four players in two teams. Before starting, the starting player picks a trump suit (a.k.a. "Tjall"). This is the suit that beats all other suits; the others are worth the same. The tjall will be the same for the entire game.

            The game is played in rounds ("tricks"). In each round, each player plays one card. The player who played the highest card of the leading suit wins the round. All players have to play a card of the suit first played if they have one. If they don't, they can play any card. First, a card is determined to be higher or lower depending on suit:

            Tjall > Starting suit > Other suits

            If the winner can't be determined yet, for example if two Tjall cards are played, the value of the card is determined:

            Ace > King > Queen > Jack > 10 > 9 > 8 ... 3 > 2

            The player with the highest card will win the round. The winner of the round will start the next round. The game ends when 7 rounds have been won by one team. If the player who picked the Tjall suit wins the round, they get to pick again the next game; otherwise, the other team gets to pick the Tjall suit.
